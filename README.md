## Hey! ðŸ‘‹

I have created this script which allows to perform all the reconnaissance phase on CTF machines, it contains the nmap tool and wfuzz.

-Nmap is used for open port and port-associated services reconnaissance.
-Wfuzz is used to discover hidden routes in web sites.

## Usage:

Assign execution permissions.

```sh
 chmod +x AutomaticScanner.py
```

```sh
  python3 Scanner.py 127.0.0.1
```
