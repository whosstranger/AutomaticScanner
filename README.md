## Hey! ðŸ‘‹

I have created this script which allows to perform all the reconnaissance phase on CTF machines, it contains the nmap tool and wfuzz.

-Nmap is used for open port and port-associated services reconnaissance.

-Wfuzz is used to discover hidden routes in web sites.

## Usage:

Assign execution permissions.

```sh
chmod +x AutomaticScanner.py
```

Script execution.

```sh
python3 Scanner.py 127.0.0.1
```
You can choose 4 different options.
  1. Scan Ports.
  2. Scan Services.
  3. Fuzzing.
  4. Help.

Selection 1.
```sh
Place the ip: 127.0.0.1
```
When the IP address is sent, the nmap tool will start scanning the open ports of the sent IP. At the end of the scan it will display the open ports of the services and ask if you want to save the information obtained.

If the answer is "Y" the information will be saved in the current directory.

Selection 2.
```sh 
Place the ip: 127.0.0.1
```

When the IP address is sent, the nmap tool will start scanning the services on each port and print the results on the screen. At the end of the service scan it will ask if you want to save the information.

If the answer is "Y" the information will be saved in the current directory.

Selection 3.
